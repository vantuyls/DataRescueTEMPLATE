## {{ site.event_name }}

_{{ site.event_name }} is a project of [OSU Libraries and Press](http://library.oregonstate.edu/) in partnership with the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org/) (EDGI), PPEHlab’s  [DataRefuge](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge) project, and the Internet Archive's [End of Term Presidential Harvest](http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/)._

**{{ site.event_name }}** brings together concerned citizens with experts in information technology, archiving, science, humanities, and policy. We need capable web-savvy and technical members of the public, librarians, and people with research and/or federal agency data expertise. Building on experience from similar events, everyone’s skills will be put to work in organized cooperation.

{{ site.event_name }} works to secure federal datasets in the face of major, federal, administrative change.

Join us for a day of preserving valuable government datasets from attempts to undermine science in the public service. Bring your laptop, water bottle and snacks. We'll be focusing our time on the USDA Forest Service and the USDA Agricultural Research Service, though we may seek out USDA-related departments or programs that may be at immediate risk. We're open to ideas and feedback, so bring those with you!
