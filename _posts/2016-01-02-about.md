## DataRescue - Oregon State University

_DataRescue - Oregon State University is a project of [OSU Libraries and Press] (http://library.oregonstate.edu/) in partnership with the [Environmental Data and Governance Initiative](https://envirodatagov.org/) (EDGI), PPEHlab’s  [DataRefuge](http://www.ppehlab.org/datarefuge) project, and the Internet Archive's [End of Term Presidential Harvest](http://eotarchive.cdlib.org/)._

**DataRescue - Oregon State University** brings together concerned citizens with experts in information technology, archiving and environmental science and policy. We need capable web-savvy and technical members of the public, librarians, and people with environmental expertise. Building on experience from similar events, everyone’s skills will be put to work in organized cooperation.

DataRescue - Oregon State University works to secure federal datasets in the face of major, federal, administrative change.

Join us for a day of preserving valuable government datasets from attempts to undermine science in the public service. Bring your laptop, water bottle and snacks.
